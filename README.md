# FakeOS Project

Here is a recreation of a Windows 98 desktop.

- Internet Explorer - image of / playing youtube video
- My Little Pony: Friendship Gardens - slideshow modal of images
- Notepad - textarea
- Recycle Bin - discarded icons

## Full Overview

The goal of this project is to have students explore and consolidate their understandings of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
This project will require you to replicate the layout and format of a design/image using CSS, add content via HTML and control the interactive elements via JavaScript.

### Features

- You will be creating an SPA (Single Page Application)
- Desktop has a wallpaper that fits the viewport
- There will be selectable icons
- Selecting an icon will open an "app", creating a _modal_ to display some content
- Able to close an app
- There will be a selectable menu
- Selecting the menu will display a list of text and icons
- The current time is displayed somewhere

## MVP:

### HTML/SCSS

- Wallpaper scales to fit the viewport
- Minimum 3 icons on desktop
- The menu is positioned in the appropriate place (bottom left on windows, top of the screen on android)
- Apps look consistent
- Menu contains a flex with content inside it
- Apps should be able to contain text, an image or a form

### JavaScript

- Put your js code into separate files
- Your icons and menu should add event listener for the click event, don't use the html onclick attribute
- Give your functions and variables good names
- Use the arrow syntax to declare functions

### Github

- Create a repo on github with a README
- Add your coach as a contributor to the repo
- Create and checkout develop branch
- Push all changes to your develop branch
- When submitting create a pull request from develop into main for review
- Add coach as a reviewer
